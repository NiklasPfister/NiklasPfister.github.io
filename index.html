<p>Associate Professor of Statistics<br />
<a href="https://cocala.github.io/">Copenhagen Causality Lab</a><br />
<a href="https://www.math.ku.dk/english/">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a></p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>My research focuses on statistical methodology for complex data
structures. Developing statistical tools that help us understand
underlying causal mechanisms is becoming more important as our data
collection capabilities increase. Much of my work uses some notion of
causality and stability to model and infer parts of such mechanisms
using data.</p>

<p>Statistical methodology should be driven by applied problems which I
try to reflect in my approach to research.</p>

<p><em>Keywords:</em> applied biology, causality, dynamical systems, independence
testing, kernel methods, time series</p>
